		<p class="main_intro">WhrsThat is a simple and fun way for friends to plan an event.  Just simply create an event by uploading a photo of where you are or where you plan to be.  WhrsThat will communicate your location through your uploaded photo to your invited friends.    Unlike other group planning sites, WhrsThat provides your friendsâ€™ etas and streamlines the process of getting to the event with our Uber integration.   From planning a picnic to rallying a group of friends for happy hour,  WhrsThat is building a better way to share group social events and eliminating the need for lengthy group chats or email chains.</p><br />
